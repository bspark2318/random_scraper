  "summary": "Solana's performance in the third quarter of 2025 reveals a mixed economic landscape, marked by a significant 30% decline in active addresses and over 40% drop in operational efficiency. The network's Real Economic Value (REV) fell 18% to $222.7 million, while Real Onchain Yield plummeted 48% to 0.47%. However, stablecoin activity provided a silver lining, with total stablecoin supply increasing by 37% to $14.6 billion, driven largely by USDC. Daily stablecoin transfer volumes rose by 50%, indicating healthier transactional activity. Despite these positives, DeFi metrics were mixed, with decentralized exchange volumes up 7.2% but trading revenues down 5%. On a macro level, Solana's total value locked (TVL) climbed 33% to $11.5 billion, and the staking rewards were primarily supported by SOL issuance. Comparatively, Solana's revenue generation outpaced Ethereum's at a similar growth stage, generating $2.85 billion between October 2024 and September 2025. In the broader cryptocurrency market, Ethereum experienced a wave of inflows despite overall market turbulence, with investors viewing its weakness as a buying opportunity. Meanwhile, altcoins, including Solana, benefitted from anticipated ETP launches, attracting significant capital inflows. This environment reflects a complex interplay of declining on-chain activity for Solana, contrasted with increasing stablecoin usage and investor optimism in the broader market.",
